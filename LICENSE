3. Seriously, this is just a hobby project. If you manage to break something with this code, you probably have bigger problems. 

4. Use this code, share it with your friends, modify it, make it better (or worse). Just have fun with it. But remember, if you make millions off it, a thank you note would be nice.

5. If you are reading this, congratulations! You are one of the few who actually reads license files. You deserve a cookie. üç™

In summary, this is free software, provided "as is", and you're welcome to use it however you like. Just don't blame us if things go horribly wrong. Enjoy!
